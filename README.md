# ShiftedProximalOperators
small repo for our own proxes in TRNC

[![CI](https://github.com/rjbaraldi/ShiftedProximalOperators/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rjbaraldi/ShiftedProximalOperators/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

TODO: 
finish populating operators, decide what variables to keep track off -> maybe shift can do all of this?
